I personally have always loved java and C# style and syntax, but having tried ruby on rails there is no ignoring dynamic languages ability to get stuff done. Especially one with functional style that makes programming fun. 

Grails makes extensive use of groovy and even more interesting is the way they have wrapped some mature favorites (junit, ant and hybernate) with the groovy language. They have a powerful mvc and a really streamline workflow. You have to try it. 

## Installing Grails on Ubuntu

You'll want to purge the openjdk and install oracle's version

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo apt-get purge openjdk*
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
<% end %>

Then you'll need to set the JAVA_HOME in your .bashrc. Something like this...

<% code("bash") do %>
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/bin
<% end %>

Lastly you'll want to install grails with the GVM here: http://gvmtool.net/
