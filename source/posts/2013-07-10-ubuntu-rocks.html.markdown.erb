UPDATED: Nov 15, 2014 - Ubuntu Gnome 14.04

Ubuntu 14 is fantastic, stable and I've truly been enjoying it. For my friends and family, here is a cheatsheet for getting your system up and running.

## Get Ubuntu Gnome

The default Unity interface sucks..  So be sure to download [Ubuntu Gnome 14.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/releases/14.04/release/), burn it to a CD/thumb drive and install it side-by-side with windows.

## The Basics

Ubuntu Restricted Extra's makes all rich media work, vlc will play anything and gimp is your open source photoshop and some other goodies you'll need.

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras vlc gimp alacarte
<% end %>

No need to worry about ssd trim anymore.  We've got these out of the box. :)


### Ditch Firefox for Chrome

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) can be downloaded from google or [installed from the command line](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-google-chrome-in-ubuntu-linux-12-xx-13-xx/) like so.

<% code("bash") do %>
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
<% end %>

We can't live without our [hangouts plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd?hl=en), an absolute must have!

And we'll need java, since it runs billions of devices

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
<% end %>

If you get a message complaining, be sure to run the fix command that the message instructs you to run... then re-run the 'sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer'

## Customize

You can only install gnome extensions in firefox.  I highly recomend browsing to these in firefox and installing them:

* [insensitive-message-tray](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/616/insensitive-message-tray/)
* [Taskbar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/584/taskbar/)
* [todo-list](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/162/todo-list/)
* [wallpaper slideshow](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/543/backslide/)

If you're like me you get tired of the animation when you bring up the applications menu.  Disable it with this:

<% code("bash") do %>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false
<% end %>

## Programmer stuff

Install and setup git

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo apt-get install git
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global push.default simple
<% end %>

[Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) is a great all-purpose editor for programmers, also [installable via the command line](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/07/sublime-text-3-ubuntu-ppa-now-available.html) with this:

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer
<% end %>

And make sure you get your [package manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)

Setup your [ssh-key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) for source control sites like [github](https://github.com/) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)

<% code("bash") do %>
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
<% end %>

then copy-n-paste the output into your account settings on github or bitbucket

## Ruby, Rails & Tmux

Don't miss out on my other blog posts that walk you through installing [Ruby & Rails](http://www.beesbot.com/rbenv-ubuntu-bundler/) and [Tmux](http://www.beesbot.com/ubuntu-tmux/).

## And That's All

You've got ubuntu + things it should have come with anyway.

Enjoy!
