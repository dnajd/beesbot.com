I got tired of knowing nothing about DNS settings so I asked Mike.

## A Record
Maps a human readable host name (ex. www.google.com) to one or many ipaddress (ex. 1.1.1.1)

## MX Record
Mail Exchange record points to host that handles incoming mail; because tools like thunderbird search for mx record based on domain.

## NS Record
Name servers (min of 2) that are the ultimate authority on where the host name goes.  No other name server is allowed to say.

## SOA
State of authority record has the name servers for the domain; not 100% sure why this exists and who cares except for the fact that it is requirement.

## TXT
Used if you want to do forms verfication for things like email

## CNAME
Is a human readable name to another human readable name
