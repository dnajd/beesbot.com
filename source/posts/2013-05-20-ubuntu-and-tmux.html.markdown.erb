First off, from the [tmux website](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)... "tmux is a terminal multiplexer. What is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal..." 

## Easy to install on Ubuntu

<% code("bash") do %>
sudo apt-get install tmux
<% end %>

Make it run every time you open a terminal

<% code("bash") do %>
# add at the end of .bashrc
if [[ ! $TERM =~ screen ]]; then
    exec tmux
fi
<% end %>

## Use it right away...
Ctrl-b, % splits the screen vertically
Ctrl-b, " splits the screen horizontally
Ctrl-b, arrow to move between screens. arrow key in the direction you want to move

## Remember commands
You're always using tmux in the terminal, why not have your bash echo common commands every time you open a terminal.

<% code("bash") do %>
# edit the bashrc
nano ~/.bashrc

# add the following
echo "tmux commands"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "shift to highlight"
echo "ctrl b + letter"
echo "c           new window"
echo "w           list windows"
echo "&           kill window"
<% end %>

## Configuration
I added this because I wanted my mouse wheel to scroll up; note, hit the escape key to get out of scroll mode

<% code("bash") do %>
echo "set-window-option -g mode-mouse on" >> ~/.tmux.conf
<% end %>
