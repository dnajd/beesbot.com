Nao is truly amazing.  I was accepted to the [Nao Developer Program](http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Solutions/For-Development/developer-program.html) a few months back and have received a [Nao Robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNbj2G3GmAo) from Aldebaran Robotics.

I've been learning about the robot and writing applications in Python for a few weeks now.  I created a video of an application I wrote that demonstrates some of Nao's capabilities.

* Face Recognition - when I walk up
* Text to speech - says "hi"
* Voice Recognition - When I ask him about books
* Object Recognition - recognizes books

I am just scratching the surface in terms of the capabilities Nao has.  My five year old son and I work with him each night and hope to learn more about robotics.
