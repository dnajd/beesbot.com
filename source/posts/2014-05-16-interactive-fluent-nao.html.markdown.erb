Here I will show you how to set up Fluent Nao code to interactively control Nao.


## Setup Pynaoqi Python SDK

Download the [Python SDK](https://community.aldebaran-robotics.com/resources/) from Aldebaran's community site and extract it into a folder on your computer.

Afer that add the folder to your PYTHONPATH by editing you .bashrc or .profile file.  For example on my linux system I added the following to my .bashrc

<% code("bash") do %>
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/development/opensource/pynaoqi-python2.7-2.1.0.19-linux64
<% end %>


## Setup Fluent Nao

Next up you'll need to clone fluent nao using [git](http://git-scm.com/)

<% code("bash") do %>
git clone https://github.com/dnajd/FluentNao.git
<% end %>

And add the src/main/python folder to your .bashrc or .profile file.  For example on my system I added the following to my .bashrc

<% code("bash") do %>
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/development/opensource/FluentNao/src/main/python
<% end %>


## Bootstrap Python

To test things out you can edit the bootstrap.py file in the root of the FluentNao code you checked out.

* Update the following line to Nao's ipaddress if needed.
* Get Nao's ipaddress by pushing his chest button once.

<% code("python") do %>
naoIp = "192.168.2.12"
<% end %>

Then run the bootstrap file in an interactive python shell to connect

<% code("bash") do %>
python -i bootstrap.py
<% end %>


## Interactively Control Nao

Run a [FluentNao commands](https://github.com/dnajd/FluentNao/wiki) to test it out.

<% code("bash") do %>
nao.say('hi')
<% end %>

If that worked you're ready to go.
