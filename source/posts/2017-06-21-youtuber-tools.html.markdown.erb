So my kids want to be youtubers and I want to keep them excited about it. I wanted to buy them gear, setup software and get them into the details.  Here is what I ended up with.

# Hardware

## [Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/)
I picked up two of these to capture the kids expressions while they are making a video.

## [TONOR XLR Condenser Microphone w/ Arm Stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KHMUQ2M)
I bought two of these condenser mics to capture both kids voice. These also improve audio and only pick up audio from one side; this prevents echo from two people recording into one video at the same time.

## [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (2nd Gen)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6T56EA/)
You plug the two microphones into this USB Audio Interface and it goes into the computer with through USB.

# Software

## [Open Broadcasting Software](https://obsproject.com/)
Free video recording and live streaming.  This software is so easy to use, the kids had no problem picking it up.  With it they can create a opening screen with a images and text, transition into game play and transition again into a closing screen.  It was also simple to overly the webcam so you could see them while they play.  Look on youtube for a tutorial and you'll literally have this working in minutes.

## [OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org/)
Free Video Editor designed to be an easy to use and quick to learn. We also watched a quick youtube tutorial on this and were able to cut out the parts of their videos they did not like.
