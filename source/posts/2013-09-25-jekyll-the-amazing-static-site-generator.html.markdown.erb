You're used to thinking cms or wordpress for building websites that require templating or ease of editing; but in my experience 90% of the time it ends up feeling like your "killing an ant with a sledgehammer".  It's not every day you discover a vastly more simple solution to a very common problem, but static site generators + markdown are it.  I'm convinced.

## Build Websites

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that helps developers build websites and solves problems including:

* templates & partials - easy to maintain and [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)
* [canonical urls](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-url-canonicalization/) - seo friendly
* asset optimiziation - blazing fast
* markdown - really easy to edit
* free hosting - when combined with github pages

### And What's More
It does this without a hundred thousand pounds of code, without more expensive hosting, without needing tons of security patches and without a database.  In my mind it's a whole new way of building website and it's refreshing.

## One Catch
You have to install ruby and the gem. But it's really not that big of a deal...

### 1. Install Ruby

You can use [my preferred approach](/ubuntu/rbenv/ruby/bundler/2013/02/10/rbenv-ubuntu-bundler.html) or find instructions on google quite easily

### 2. Install the jekyll gem

<% code("bash") do %>
gem install jekyll
<% end %>


### 3. Add Jekyll to your path
On my machine I found Jekyll in the following folder and added it to my .bashrc as follows

<% code("bash") do %>
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME//.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p362/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/jekyll-1.1.2/bin"
<% end %>

Then you can create a jekyll site with the following:
jekyll new my-site

Try it out... it's fantastic.
