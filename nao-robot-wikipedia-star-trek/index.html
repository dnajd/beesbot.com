        <h1>Nao Robot Tells Encounter at Farpoint</h1>
        <p class="date">2015-01-06</p>
        <p>I spent a bit of time exploring the Nao Robot's new <a href="http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/getting_started/helloworld_choregraphe_dialog.html">dialog</a> capabilities.  Once I knew my way around I converted a wikipedia article on the Star Trek episode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encounter_at_Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a> into a sort of choose your own adventure.</p>

<p>It only took a few minutes and my son enjoyed hearing the story from Nao and responding to inquiries to affect the story.</p>

    u1: ("yes") Course is set, engaging at warp 5. ^goto(chap2)
    u1: ("no") Starfeet warns you that if you do not perform your mission you will lose your ship. ^goto(chap2)

u: ("chapter 2") %chap2 Your mission is to open relations with the simple Bandi people who have tapped a immense energy source and used it to construct Farpoint Station. An omnipotent being appears and identifies himself as the Q. He demands you head home.
    u1: (~attack) your first officer draws his phaser and the Q freezes him. ^goto(chap3)
    u1: (~explore) you ask Q what he wants? ^goto(chap3)
    u1: (~retreat) you try to outrun the Q at warp 9.5 but it does not work ^goto(chap3)

u: ("chapter 3") %chap3 The Q warns you that your mission is destined to fail and then leaves. The Enterprise arrives at Deneb 4 and the crew is suspicious of how certain items they desire appear out of nowhere.
 	u1: (~attack) attacking a nonviolent race is against the prime directive. ^goto(chap4)

    u1: (~retreat) You are about to beam of the planet when ^goto(chap4)

u: ("chapter 5") %chap5 a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement. you order the crew to fire phasers at the craft, but the Q appears to remind you of humanity'</span>s violent tendencies.

The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature. It occurs to you that Zorn exploited this creatures ability to synthesize matter and used it to create Farpoint Station.

The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells you that they have succeeded <span class="k">in </span>their <span class="nb">test</span>, but hints that he will be back
