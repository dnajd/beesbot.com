        <h1>Youtuber Hardware and Software</h1>
        <p class="date">2017-06-21</p>
        <p>So my kids want to be youtubers and I want to keep them excited about it. I wanted to buy them gear, setup software and get them into the details.  Here is what I ended up with.</p>

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

<h2 id="logitech-hd-pro-webcam-c920httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb006jh8t3s"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/">Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920</a></h2>
<p>I picked up two of these to capture the kids expressions while they are making a video.

<h2 id="tonor-xlr-condenser-microphone-w-arm-standhttpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01khmuq2m"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KHMUQ2M">TONOR XLR Condenser Microphone w/ Arm Stand</a></h2>
<p>I bought two of these condenser mics to capture both kids voice. These also improve audio and only pick up audio from one side; this prevents echo from two people recording into one video at the same time.

<h2 id="focusrite-scarlett-2i2-2nd-genhttpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01e6t56ea"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6T56EA/">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (2nd Gen)</a></h2>
<p>You plug the two microphones into this USB Audio Interface and it goes into the computer with through USB.</p>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

<h2 id="open-broadcasting-softwarehttpsobsprojectcom"><a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcasting Software</a></h2>
<p>Free video recording and live streaming.  This software is so easy to use, the kids had no problem picking it up.  With it they can create a opening screen with a images and text, transition into game play and transition again into a closing screen.  It was also simple to overly the webcam so you could see them while they play.  Look on youtube for a tutorial and you'll literally have this working in minutes.</p>

<h2 id="openshothttpwwwopenshotorg"><a href="http://www.openshot.org/">OpenShot</a></h2>
<p>Free Video Editor designed to be an easy to use and quick to learn. We also watched a quick youtube tutorial on this and were able to cut out the parts of their videos they did not like.</p>
